# FINAL PROJECT: Motion Planning for a Dubins Car using RRT
## Submitted by: Huzefa S.H. Kagalwala, Ashit Mohanty, Rakshita GM, Rahil Modi.

## 1. Problem Statement:
This project aims at using RRT (Rapidly exploring Random Trees) to create a roadmap and plans a path to maneuver a non-holonomic car (a Dubinâ€™s car model) to move from an initial state to a goal state in 2-dimensional space.

## 2. Code Explanation:
### Build Phase:
In the build phase, the initial state is first added to the tree. The  random nodes are generated and connected to the tree.
### Extend Phase:
Here, the nearest node (from RRT) to the random node generated is found. The new node is generated by propagating the neighbour node along the direction of random node by a set distance. The new node is added to the tree after checking for collision. If the new node added is the goal node, then the RRT stops building. The nodes which are added to the tree are joined using the Dubins curves.

## 3. Instructions
1. To run this code, run the `CPSC8810_Final_Project_Code_RRT_Dubins.py` file
2. The code will prompt you to insert the (x,y) coordinates in a certain limit and an orientation angle of the agent.
